  From March, 2021 to August, 2021, I camped at Micro Center Dallas and bought 30 series GPUs to
  create and expand the Phillips mining rig.  At its peak, the mining rig ran 51 GPUs, 10 CPUs, and several
  Helium miners in my former bedroom.  The mining rig has four owners, myself, Nate Phillips (brother), Abram Gonzalez (friend), and Alex Sanchez (friend).

  Initially, there was no intention on mining with GPUs.  I wanted a computer upgrade, but I realized that I could make money and learn a lot from the people there, so I continued.  During March 2021 people showed up early in the morning and everyone was satisfied with their card.  By the time
  late May came however, people would not hesitate to camp for a day for a GPU.  At the peak, people camped out for five days for a GPU.
