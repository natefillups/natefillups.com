<div class="box">Work Experience</div>

<div class="text">

<p>From May 2022 to July 2022, I worked at Herbert-ABS Software Solutions LLC. Herbert-ABS is a software company concerned with developing analysis and design tools that aid in Maritime tasks. I first conducted research on a genetic algorithm library that would be compatible with the code base. There are thousands of Python ML libraries that support different operations. Mine had to be compatible with basic functions, such as crossover and gene mutation. The ultimate conclusion was that no libraries were suitable given our constraints, so we made our own NGSA-II algorithm library. After researching, I ported their old Visual Basic 6 code from a previous release to Python 2.7. The deceivingly challenging task led me to learn about the code base extensively. During my final few weeks, I coded in C# on the main HECSTAB software. Having already familiarized myself with the code base, I was able to develop the power optimization and power graph features with ease.</p>

<p>From January 2022 to March 2022, I worked at BAE Systems in Norfolk, VA where I created a ship data-sheet merger. Using python I parsed data from three different sources and combined all the data into one excel sheet. I also performed financial analysis in excel and create a CPI system for the Norfolk shipyard through the use of PowerBI. I also worked with the project director to performe ship scheduling.</p>

<p>From July 2021 to August 2021, I worked at Vigor Industrial in Seattle, WA. I did scheduling tasks for the ongoing guided missle cruisers that were getting refitted and created a program that parsed the schedule for any conflicting tasks.</p>

<p>From January 2021 to March 2021, I worked at Metal Shark Boats in Rijeka, Croatia. I worked as a structural engineering intern and performed FEA on different parts of vessels. I used Rhino to start initial design for a 100m sailboat from AutoCAD.</p>

<p>From January 2020 to March 2020, I worked at Resolve Marine in Theodore, AL. I worked as a shipyard intern and performed basic shipyard tasks including mooring, docking, painting, operating, and handling equipment as they got prepped to send it out on salvage operations.</p>

<p>I am currently working on my thesis titled, "Collision Avoidance on Autonomous Vessels" where I am training a neural network through reinforcement learning on <a href="https://www.unity.com">Unity</a>. I am training the neural network to do basic pathfinding while avoiding collision with other vessels in real-time.</p>
