<div class="box">About Me</div>

<div class="text">
<p>
As a high level summary, I am a well-known leader who is distinguished by a
<a href="https://github.com/natefillups">hands-on approach</a> to building systems.
</p>

<ul>
<li>I am current a student attend <a href="https://www.webb.edu/">Webb Institute</a> graduating in June 2023.</li>

<li>I am studying Naval Architecture & Marine Engineering at school, but I have a strong passion for computer programming.</li>

<li>The largest project I've worked on is my thesis on collision avoidance on autonomous vessels with the use of <a href="https://www.unity.com">Unity</a>. Using reinforcement learning I am training a neural network model that will react in real time and follow USCG rules of the road at the same time.</li>

<li>I have done smaller projects around school such as student store kiosks, power system management automation through embedded systems, and other control systems.</li>

<li>Co-founder of <a href="mining.html">Phillips Mining</a>.</li>

<li>Proficient in Traditional Mandarin Chinese and English.</li>

<div class="box">Work Experience</div>

<div class="text">

<p>From May 2022-September 2022, I worked at Herbert ABS in Alameda, CA where I co created a genetic algorithm library (NGSA-II). This helped optimize ship tank and cargo distribution and used C# libraries to create an oxyplot with the new data points. I also performed basic python scripting to test ship alarms and ballast systems.</p>

<p>From January 2022-March 2022, I worked at BAE Systems in Norfolk, VA where I created a ship data-sheet merger. Using python I parsed data from three different sources and combined all the data into one excel sheet. I also performed financial analysis in excel and create a CPI system for the Norfolk shipyard through the use of PowerBI. I also worked with the project director to performe ship scheduling.</p>

<p>From July 2021-August 2021, I worked at Vigor Industrial in Seattle, WA. I did scheduling tasks for the ongoing guided missle cruisers that were getting refitted and created a program that parsed the schedule for any conflicting tasks.</p>

<p>From January 2021-March 2021, I worked at Metal Shark Boats in Rijeka, Croatia. I worked as a structural engineering intern and performed FEA on different parts of vessels. I used Rhino to start initial design for a 100m sailboat from AutoCAD.</p>

<p>From January 2020-March 2020, I worked at Resolve Marine in Theodore, AL. I worked as a shipyard intern and performed basic shipyard tasks including mooring, docking, painting, operating, and handling equipment as they got prepped to send it out on salvage operations.</p>

<div class="box">Projects</div>

<div class="text">

<p>I am currently working on my thesis titled, "Collision Avoidance on Autonomous Vessels" where I am training a neural network through reinforcement learning on <a href="https://www.unity.com">Unity</a>. I am training the neural network to do basic pathfinding while avoiding collision with other vessels in real-time.</p>
