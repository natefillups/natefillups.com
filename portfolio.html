<!-- <p class="test"><b>Hackathons</b></p>
<p class="test">I have attended the following hackathons:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="https://www.hacktx.com">HackTX</a></b> - The project can found at <a href="https://hacktx.arjunlalith.com"> hacktx.arjunlalith.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="test">I plan on attending the following hackathons over the course of the Spring Semester:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="https://www.tamuhack.com">TAMUHack</a></b> January 25 - 26</li>
</ul> -->

<p class="test"><b>Learning Resources</b></p>
<p class="test">I use the following websites to expand my knowledge of Computer Science</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.leetcode.com">leetcode</a> -  leetcode is a great way to practice for technical interviews. They provide a variety of whiteboard problems to help you understand concepts well. They also allow you to see how efficient your algorithms are compared to previous submissions, which allows you to have a greater understanding of where you stand among your peers.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN">Live Overflow's series on Binary Exploitation</a> -  This series is great for those who are looking to get into Cyber Security and Binary Exploitation. The first few videos start out very basic, but quickly become difficult. Even if you are not interested in Cyber Security, I recommend at least learning a basic shell code injection in order to better understand assembly and how a program works.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <p class="test"><b>CTFs</b></p>
<p class="test">I will be parcipating in the following CTFs during the Fall semester:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://ctf.csaw.io/">CSAW CTF'19 Quals</a> -  This is the first CTF of the fall semester. I hope to see where I currently stand in terms of my Cyber Security knowledge. I hope to see where I am deficient and what I can do to expand my knowledge.</li>
</ul> -->
